/**
 * CheckCash Transaction Type Class
 *
 * Attempts to redeem a Check object in the ledger to receive up to the amount authorized by the corresponding
 * CheckCreate transaction. Only the Destination address of a Check can cash it with a CheckCash transaction. Cashing a
 * check this way is similar to executing a Payment initiated by the destination.\n\nSince the funds for a check are not
 * guaranteed, redeeming a Check can fail because the sender does not have a high enough balance or because there is not
 * enough liquidity to deliver the funds. If this happens, the Check remains in the ledger and the destination can try
 * to cash it again later, or for a different amount.
 *
